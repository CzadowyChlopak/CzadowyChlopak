<br />Hi, I am Dominik - a dev from Poland, settled in Warsaw.
<br /><br />Biology science is my passion and I really appreciate the knowledge of how the human body works. At the university the coding was shown to me and right now I am doing my best to merge those 2 fields at my free time. In that case I am mainly using Python 3. 
<br /><br />During my work time I mainly develop automatizations and tools that allows reducing work volume for my colleagues or customers. Sometimes these are easier to develop VBA macros, sometimes these are more complex unattended bots.

**:floppy_disk:The technologies that I am mainly using:**
- Python 3
- Power Automate for Desktop
- VBA
- SQL

This is my core of work and in those I feel quite strong. Also I am still learning new things - commonly I use youtube tutorials to get my hands dirty and after that doing something similar on my own, but also I really like to read books in case of selflearning. On the other hand the Microsoft learning is also helpful.

**:green_book:Here is a list of books that I have finished:**
- *'Learn C the hard way: Practical Excercises on the Computational Subjects You Keep Avoiding (Like C)'*, Zed A. Shaw
- *'Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python'*, Mathew Kirk
- *Advanced Deep Learning with TensorFlow 2 and Keras: Apply DL, GANs, VAEs, deepRL, unsupervisedlearning, object detection and segmentation, and more. 2nd Edition'*, Rowel Atienza
- *'Black Hat Python: Python programming for hackers and pentesters'*, Justin Seitz
- *'Python - course for teachers and students'*, Gniewomir Sarbicki
